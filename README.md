# Wiki

## Rats

Rats can be found in previously inhabited villages that are now abandoned. Once a natural village no longer has tenants, rats will start spawning if a player is near that empty village and the village still has beds.

### Behaviours

Rats will behave in a very similar manner to wolves, attacking what the player targets or what harms the player or themselves. They have 8 health points (4 hearts) and deal one point of damage but ignore invulnerability ticks, making a mischief stronger the bigger it becomes.
Rats take fall damage starting from 15 blocks, can breathe five times longer than normal creatures, ignore damage from cacti and berry bushes and can be tamed with any food, the better the food though, the higher the chance of success. Once tamed you will be able to sit them down and or let them follow you. If they see a cat while following you around they will be distracted chasing it away.

Rats will pick up any item stack on the floor they come across, and bring it back to their owner if they are tamed. If they are hurt and the item is edible, they will consume it and restore an amount of health equivalent to the amount of saturation the food gives as well as apply any effects the food provides. No matter their state, if rats come across a drinkable potion, they will consume it and get its effects and, once again, convert saturation to regeneration.

#### World Rat Day

On April 4th, World Rat Day, all rats will smug dance and the chance of golden rats spawning increases from 1 in 150 to 1 in 30!

Rats can spawn in eight different variants and also have a few special variants that you can acquire by renaming your rats with a nametag.

### Elytrats

Elytrats are a special rat variant, acquired by equipping rats with the elytrat item, crafted as shown below. Equip/unequip a rat by simply shift-using the rat with the elytrat/bare fist. Normal rats will also equip elytrats upon picking them up from the floor.

Elytrats can and will fly to attack enemies and to follow you on your airborne adventures! Just as any other rat they can be picked up with rat pouches. Elytrats also feature custom elytra textures for special rat variants and the golden rat.

## Accessories

### Staves

When appearing naturally in an empty village, rats may spawn with staves in their possession. These staves can be obtained by taming the rats possessing them and are useful to make the rats perform specific tasks. Each staff use orders the rats to execute the corresponding order for 15 seconds, items acquired by the rats will be brought to you and required items can be dropped on the floor for them.

- **Harvest Staff:** Harvest any mature crop and replant any cultivatable item on farmland tiles.
- **Love Staff:** Rats breed all the animals around them (including themselves) as long as they have the corresponding food.
- **Collection Staff:** Use with an item in the other hand to make rats break the corresponding blocks they come across. Rats can break blocks with a hardness of 1 plus 1 per level of strength that is applied to them. Haste effects boost their mining speed by 20% per level of haste.

### Rat Pouches

Rat pouches can be used to quickly gather rats back. Using a pouch on a rat will put that rat inside the pouch. Shift-using an empty rat pouch will gather all rats that the pouch can hold in the vicinity. Shift-using a filled rat pouch releases all rats inside it.

Pouches can be crafted like bundles with leather, twisted vines and popped chorus fruit, to produce respectively pouches with a capacity of 5, 10 and 20 rats.
Rats stored in Pouches won't age, meaning they will keep status effects, health, their variant and names.

### Mask of Rat

Acquired by either purchasing them for 40 emeralds from a wandering trader or killing doctor4t on a multiplayer server, this item has a protection value of just one armour bar but the enchantibility of gold.

The person wearing this mask will not be able to harm wild or tamed rats and all their status effects as well as the armour and enchantments of the mask will be provided to all tamed rats. This includes positive and negative status effects such as invisibility and hunger.

This item can be repaired in an anvil using phantom membranes.
